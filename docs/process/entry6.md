# Separating client and host

I'm currently trying to find the best way to separate between client and host code. I'm thinking of not including all the host/client scripts together but not exactly sure the best way to it. Obviously, this is perfect for webpack but I don't really want to rebuild the entire foundation of the app just to save 15kb file size so I'm going to just combine the two files for now.
