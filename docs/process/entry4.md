# UI Developments

The most recent development in programming the calendar behaviors in response to user input has been trying to make the days mold together if multiple days selected. As of 9:38AM Jan 3, I've gotten the CSS to work in my favor and so all I need to do is to now add the classes when selected days are grouped together.

Update (7:31AM Jan 4): After a ton of tinkering with the CSS and advanced CSS selectors, I managed to make the transitions work. The UI of the calendar is pretty much exactly how I originally wanted it to work. With this done, all I really need to work on is functionality

# Small Changes

## Implemented

* Added year to calendar title as well as additional styling to make it look nice

* Added buttons to help with schedule creation

* Updated look to calendar as well as new animations

## To Implement

* Saving data

# Changes wrap up

Most of the changes un the most recent update are cosmetic and pretty much only influence the look and feel of the app. The standard functionality isn't implemented yet and that's what I'm looking the work on next.
